Testing & dd-agent
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DataDog/dd-agent.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DataDog/dd-agent) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/y7v5la94393mi5lc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Datadog/dd-agent)

# Lint

Your code should always be clean when doing `rake lint`. It runs `flake8`, ignoring these [rules](../tox.ini).


# Organisation of the tests directory

```bash
tests
├── checks # tests of checks.d/*
│   ├── integration # contains all real integration tests (run on Travis/Appveyor)
│   ├── mock # contains mocked tests (run on Travis)
│   └── fixtures # files needed by tests (conf files, mocks, ...)
└── core # core agent tests (unit and integration tests, run on Travis)
    └── fixtures # files needed by tests
```

We use [rake](http://docs.seattlerb.org/rake/) & [nosetests](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to manage the tests.

To run individual tests:
```
# Whole file
nosetests tests/checks/mock/test_system_swap.py
# Whole class
nosetests tests/checks/mock/test_system_swap.py:SystemSwapTestCase
# Single test case
nosetests tests/checks/mock/test_system_swap.py:SystemSwapTestCase.test_system_swap
```

To run a specific ci flavor (our way of splitting tests, for more details see [integration tests](#integration-tests)):
```
# Run the flavor my_flavor
rake ci:run[my_flavor]
```

# Unit tests

They are split in different flavors:
```
# Run the mock/unit core tests
rake ci:run

# Run mock/unit checks tests
rake ci:run[checks_mock]

# Agent core integration tests (can take more than 5min)
rake ci:run[core_integration]
```


# Integration tests

They ensure that the agent is correctly talking to third party software which is necessary for most checks.

They are great because they mimic a real setup where someone would enable a check on a machine with this service running. Using mocks or pre-saved responses often hides corner-cases and are the source of lots of issues.

We run these tests by creating a build machine "flavor" (see Travis/Appveyor section), basically each flavor is defined by the third party software we install on this machine.

Most of the times `flavor == check_name`.

Each flavor is defined in `ci/flavor.rb`, and we set different steps for running the flavor build :

* **before_install** needs to be run before installation
* **install** installs the 3p software
* **before_script** generally setups the software and launch it in background
* **script** runs nosetests with a filter (see how to write tests)
* **cleanup** stops the software and remove unnecessary data (not running on Travis/Appveyor, because the buildboxes are disposable)
* **before_cache** is run on Travis _(not run on Appveyor)_ to delete logs files, configuration files, ... before caching
* **cache** tars and uploads the cache to S3 _(not run on Appveyor)_

Your test cases must be written in `tests/test_flavor.py` and they must use the nose `attr` decorator to be filtered by the flavors.

```
from nose.plugins.attrib import attr

@attr(requires='bone')
class TestCheckBone(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fetch(self):
```

To run the tests locally:
```
rake ci:run[bone]
```

To create rake tasks for a new flavor you can use this [skeleton file](../ci/skeleton.rb).

# Coverage

We like to see that the metrics being generated are actually covered by tests. For the integration tests you can call the method self.coverage_report() in your test to see how many of the metrics you're actually looking at.

Note, however, that Travis and Appveyor enforce coverage. It will fail the test if you don't have 100% coverage.

But, since the we also know that the coverage report is very verbose, and that it can be annoying to fail a test for this, we don't enforce it being called where it doesn't make sense. And we also allow you to turn off the failure locally by setting the environment variable: `NO_COVERAGE=true`.


# Travis

Its configuration is stored in [.travis.yml](../.travis.yml).

It's running the exact same command described above (`rake ci:run[flavor]`), with the restriction of one flavor + version per build. (we use the [build matrix](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Build-Matrix) to split flavors)

Travis is configured to cache python libs and ruby gems between runs. We use a custom cache for third party software dependencies (PostgreSQL, Apache, ...), which are built from source.

We use the newly released [docker-based infrastructure](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/).

To add a new flavour, append your `TRAVIS_FLAVOR` to [.travis.yml](../.travis.yml).


# Appveyor

Its configuration is stored in [appveyor.yml](../appveyor.yml).

It's using the same command as Travis, `rake ci:run[flavor]`, but runs only tests with the `windows` attr: `@attr('windows', requires='flavor')`. It tests only Windows-specific checks, with python 2.7 (32 and 64 bits).

Third parties softwares are not build from source, instead it uses [pre-installed programs](http://www.appveyor.com/docs/installed-software#services-and-databases).

Appveyor is caching gems & pywin32 exe (needed for WMI), there is no custom caching.

To add a new flavour, append the flavor to the comma-separated list of `FLAVORS` to [appveyor.yml](../appveyor.yml).


# Add an integration test

Please read first the [integration test description](#integration-tests).

It's really straightforward if the integration you want to add can be easily installed from source. Otherwise, it might be more complicated.

Copy `ci/skeleton.rb` in `ci/flavor.rb` (`flavor` being the name of your check). Then you can follow the example of `ci/lighttpd.rb` to see how to install your `flavor` and configure it.

All configuration files needed for the ci to run should be in `ci/resources/flavor/`, and then before the test run copied to the right directory (generally `$INTEGRATIONS_DIR/flavor_version`). `$VOLATILE_DIR` should receive all temporary files (such as pid file, data files, ...), and `$INTEGRATIONS_DIR/flavor_version` should contain the program once compiled, ready to be cached and speed up the build on Travis.

Then add your `flavor` in [Rakefile](../Rakefile) (`require ./ci/flavor`).

You can test it by runnnig `rake ci:run[flavor]`.

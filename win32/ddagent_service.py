"""
A Windows Service wrapper for win32/agent.py which consists in a minimalistic
supervisor for our agent with restart tries in case of failure. This program
will be packaged into an .exe file with py2exe in our omnibus build. It doesn't
have any project dependencies and shouldn't. It just launches and talks to our
Windows supervisor in our Python venv. This way the agent code isn't shipped in
an .exe file which allows for easy hacking on it's source code.

Many thanks to the author of the article below which saved me quite some time:

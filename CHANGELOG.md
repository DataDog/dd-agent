# 5.8.5 / 07-27-2016
**Windows, Linux and Source Install**

### Details
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/compare/5.8.4...5.8.5

### Future rotation of the APT signing key

In preparation for a future rotation of our package signing keys, the `5.8.5` DEB package will, on install, import a new
trusted APT key:

```
pub   4096R/382E94DE 2016-06-29 [expires: 2022-06-28]
uid                  Datadog, Inc <package@datadoghq.com>
```

During the package install, the DEB package will output the following:

```
Prepare Datadog Agent keys rotation
  Add the new 'Datadog, Inc <package@datadoghq.com>' key to the list of APT trusted keys. ... OK
```

The signing key of the Agent hasn't changed yet but will be switched to this new key in a future release.

### Service Discovery
Starting with the 5.8 release, the Datadog Agent ships with service discovery. This feature works for Docker containers and can run on platforms such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Amazon ECS.

Service discovery makes it possible to define configuration templates for a given Docker image in a configuration store, and to dynamically apply them to new containers on the fly. The Agent will then use these configuration templates combined with container metadata to enable, disable and reconfigure checks dynamically in response to container start/stop events.

For more details on Datadog Agent's Service Discovery, check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Service-discovery).

See [#2008][], [#2424][], [#2426][], [#2514][].

### Kong integration
[Kong](https://getkong.org/) is an open-source management layer for APIs.

The checks collects metrics using `/status` endpoint part of Kong RESTful API. It retrieves usage information about the node, with some basic information about the connections being processed by the underlying NGINX process, and the number of entities stored in the datastore collections.
It also submits a service check to reflect the agent's ability to connect to the instance.

See [#2241][].

A big thank you [@shashiranjan84][] !

### Spark integration
The [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) check runs from the Master Node and retrieves metrics from YARN's ResourceManager.
The collected metrics cover statistics about:
* Spark Jobs
* Spark Stages
* Spark Executors
* Spark Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)

See [#2407][].

### PowerDNS Recursor integration
The [PowerDNS Recursor](https://www.powerdns.com/) check retrieves metrics using the `/servers/localhost/statistics` endpoint part of [PowerDNS API](https://doc.powerdns.com/md/httpapi/README/) when the experimental web server is active.
The collected metrics cover the Recursor statistics: (outgoing) queries, answers, cache and cache entries.
A service check reflects the agent's ability to connect to the instance.

For more details about the metrics collected, check out the PowerDNS documentation about [Recursor Statistics](https://doc.powerdns.com/md/recursor/stats/).

See [#2108][], [#2490][].

A big thank you [@AntoCard][], [@janeczku][] !

### MapReduce & YARN updates
Hadoop MapReduce and YARN integrations have been updated to reduce and consolidate the metrics' tags.
In particular:
* `cluster_name` tag replaces `cluster_id`
* `app_name` tag replaces `app_id`

MapReduce metrics have received additional improvements and cleanups:
* Metric type `rate` replaces `gauge` when applicable
* The following metrics have been removed:
  * `mapreduce.job.map.task.progress`
  * `mapreduce.job.reduce.task.progress`

See [#2473][], [#2474][], [#2487][].

### Source install: end of Python 2.6 compatibility support
For source installation, the Datadog Agent uses system's Python. Starting with the 5.8.0 release, the Datadog Agent does not enforce compatibility with Python 2.6 anymore and requires Python 2.7. Tests and code sections used to maintain compability have been removed.

Users running a different version of Python on their system are advised to install a [packaged version of the Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent). If you have any questions, please contact our support team support(at)datadoghq(dot)com.

See [#2377][].

### Hadoop integrations (HDFS, MapReduce and YARN checks)
The Agent now includes 4 new checks to monitor Hadoop clusters:
* 2 HDFS checks (`hdfs_namenode` and `hdfs_datanode`) that collect metrics respectively from namenodes and datanodes using the JMX-HTTP API
* a MapReduce check that collects metrics on the running Mapreduce jobs from the Application Master's REST API
* a YARN check that collects metrics from YARN's ResourceManager REST API

The existing `hdfs` check is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the Agent. Its metric scope is entirely covered by the new `hdfs_namenode` check.

### TCP RTT measurement with `go-metro`
**This new feature is in beta**

The Datadog Agent on 64-bit Linux is now bundled with a new component (`go-metro`) that passively calculates TCP RTT metrics between the agent's host and external hosts, and reports them as `system.net.tcp.rtt.avg`, `system.net.tcp.rtt.jitter` and `system.net.tcp.rtt` through StatsD.

`go-metro` follows TCP streams active within a certain period of time and estimates the RTT between any outgoing packet with data, and its corresponding TCP acknowledgement.

`go-metro` runs in its own process. It's disabled by default and can be enabled like a regular check by configuring an `/etc/dd-agent/conf.d/go-metro.yaml` file and restarting the agent.

For more details on `go-metro`, check out the [project's GitHub page](https://github.com/DataDog/go-metro).

### Ceph check
The [Ceph](http://ceph.com/) check retrieves metrics from Ceph's Administration Tool command (`ceph`).

The check collects metrics from `mon_status`, `status`, `df detail`, `osd pool stats` and `osd perf`, and sends a service check reflecting the overall health of the cluster.

See [#2264][]

### MySQL
Multiple community-contributed additions to the MySQL check have been consolidated and merged, including:
* metrics from the `performance_schema` table on MySQL >= 5.6 (thanks to [@ovaistariq][])
* extra metrics on the InnoDB and MyISAM engines, from the Binlog, and from the `SHOW STATUS` query (thanks to [@ovaistariq][])
* several schema-specific metrics, including schema size, schema average query runtime and 95th percentile query execution time (thanks again to [@ovaistariq][])
* metrics on the Handler (thanks to [@polynomial][])
* Galera-specific performance stats (thanks to [@zdannar][])
* Query Cache metrics (thanks to [@leucos][])
* a `mysql.replication.slave_running` service check reflecting the state of the slaves (thanks to [@c960657][])

Most of these additional metrics are not collected by default but can be enabled in the check's YAML file. See the [YAML conf example file](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/5.7.0/conf.d/mysql.yaml.example) for details.

Various bug fixes and improvements have also been implemented:
* the Agent's connections to MySQL are handled properly to prevent stale connections
* the replication status is implemented on both the master and the slaves. On the master this status is determined by the Binlog status and the number of slaves.
* the system metrics of MySQL are retrieved w/o errors on non-linux platforms by using the `psutil` library
* the parsing of the MySQL server version is improved

Huge thanks to all our contributors for all these improvements!

See [#2116][] and [#2242][]

### Potential backward incompatibilities
#### Docker
The dockerized Agent now uses the docker hostname (provided by the `Name` param from `docker info`) as its own hostname when available. This means that for hosts running the dockerized Agent the reported hostname may change to this docker-provided hostname.

For reference, the rules followed by the Agent for its `hostname` resolution are described on this [wiki page](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Agent-Hostname).

#### MongoDB
The `collect_tcmalloc_metrics` parameter in the YAML conf is replaced with the `tcmalloc` option under `additional_metrics`.
Please refer to the [example YAML conf file](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/5.7.0/conf.d/mongo.yaml.example) for more info on the usage of the `additional_metrics` option.

#### vSphere
Instead of sending all metrics as `gauge`s, the vSphere integration now checks the types of the metrics as reported by the VMWare module, and sends metrics as `rate`s when applicable.

If you haven't enabled the `all_metrics` option on the check, the only affected metrics are `cpu.usage`, `cpu.usagemhz`, `network.received` and `network.transmitted`.
If the option is enabled, the additional affected metrics are listed [here](https://gist.github.com/olivielpeau/f6b5df2ea7f83e53ef6f). The change will affect the values of these metrics.

#### WMI check
The `wmi_check` now only supports `%` as the wildcard character in the `filters`. The support of `*` as the wildcard character, which was undocumented, has been dropped.

### Kubernetes check
The [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) check retrieves metrics from cAdvisor running under Kubelet.

See [#2031][]

### OpenStack check
The [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) check is intended to run besides individual hypervisors. It can be scoped to any set of projects living on that host via instance-level config.

At the hypervisor-level it collects:

- [Hypervisor Uptime and Statistics](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-compute-v2.1.html#os-hypervisors-v2.1)

At the project-level it collects:
- [Diagnostics for guest servers within that project](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-compute-v2.1.html#diagnostics-v2.1)
- [Absolute limits for the project](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-compute-v2.1.html#limits-v2.1)

Additionally it sends service checks to register the UP/DOWN state of networks discovered by the agent,
the locally running hypervisor, and the outward-facing (`public || internal`) API services of Nova, Neutron and Keystone

#### Authentication
While the check will run without issues as an `admin` user, it is recommended to configure a read-only `datadog` user and configure the check with the corresponding user/password. Instructions on setting up the datadog user + role , as well as the changes required to the `policy.json` file can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/talwai/b8698e061795cec9f263#configure-a-datadog-user)

#### A note on compatibility
Authentication is performed via the password method, and requires Identity API v3
Nova API v2 and v2.1 are supported, with minor additional configuration necessary for v2.


A big thank you [@mtougeron][] !

See [#1864][]

### New WMI module wrapper

Datadog Agent 5.6.0 ships a new built-in lightweight Python WMI module wrapper, built on top of `pywin32` and `win32com` extensions.

**Specifications**
* Based on top of the `pywin32` and `win32com` third party extensions only
* Compatible with `Raw`* and `Formatted` Performance Data classes
    * Dynamically resolve properties' counter types
    * Hold the previous/current `Raw` samples to compute/format new values*
* Fast and lightweight
    * Avoid queries overhead
    * Cache connections and qualifiers
    * Use `wbemFlagForwardOnly` flag to improve enumeration/memory performance

*\* `Raw` data formatting relies on the avaibility of the corresponding calculator.
Please refer to `checks.lib.wmi.counter_type` for more information*

**Usage**<br/>
The new WMI module wrapper is used among the following checks to improve speed performances:
* System
* WMI


Other checks relying on WMI collection will follow in future versions of Datadog Agent.

# 5.5.2 / 10-26-2015
### Details
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/compare/5.5.1...5.5.2

### [WARNING] Datadog Agent not reporting metrics after Daylight Saving Time (DST) ends
This release fixes a bug on servers that **are configured in local time instead of UTC Time**. If your server's clock is configured to use Daylight Saving Time (DST), the Datadog Agent might stop sending metrics for up to one hour when the Daylight Saving Time ends or until it is restarted after the Daylight Saving Time ends.

We highly recommend to upgrade to this version if your server is configured in local time.

### Changes
* [BUGFIX] Consul: Send the health state service checks of all nodes. See [#1900][] (Thanks [@jgmchan][])
* [BUGFIX] Core: Use `utcnow` instead of `now` to avoid the forwarder to run into a locked state. See [#2000][]
* [BUGFIX] Fix `pycurl` dependency issue with Windows Datadog Agent 64-bit MSI Installer.

    `consul.catalog.services_up`: tagged by `consul_datacenter` and `consul_node_id`

Supported events:

* `consul.new_leader` events when a leader change is detected.

See [#1628][]

### New Docker check
Datadog agent 5.5.0 introduces a new Docker check: 'docker_daemon'.

In terms of features, it adds:

* Support for TLS connections to the daemon
* New metrics:
 * Network metrics
 * Memory limits
 * Container size (rootfs)
 * Image size
* Support for labels (convert them into tags). Off by default, uses a list of labels that should be converted.
* Support for ECS tags: task name and task version

Backward incompatible changes:

* `docker.disk.size metric` is renamed to `docker.container.size_rw`
* Old optional metrics: https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/blob/5.4.x/checks.d/docker.py#L29-L38 Are not collected anymore
* Old tags are not supported anymore (e.g. `name` instead of container_name)

As a consequence, the previous check 'Docker' is now deprecated and will not receive further support.

See [#1908][]

### Windows 64bit - Datadog Agent
The Datadog Agent is now available in a 64bit version on Windows.
For more information, please visit [our Integrations/Agent page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/windows).

### Flare on Windows
Datadog Agent `flare` feature makes easy to ship a tarball with logs and configurations to ease agent troubleshooting. Previously exclusive to Linux, it's now available on Windows.
For more information, please visit [our wiki page](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Send-logs-to-support-using-flare).

### [Warning] JMX `host` tag issues & potential backward incompatibilities issues with service check monitors
JMX related checks -c.f. list below- were illegitimately submitting service checks tagged with the `host` value defined in the YAML configuration file. As it was overriding the agent hostname, with a value often equals to `localhost`, it was difficult to define and scope monitors based on these service checks.

The issue is addressed. JMX service checks have a new `jmx_server` tag which contains the YAML configuration host value so it does not replace the actual agent hostname in the `host` tag anymore.

**Warning**: these changes affect your JMX-service-checks related existing monitors scoped with the `host` tag. For more information, please get in touch with support[@datadoghq][].com

*JMX related checks*: ActiveMQ, Cassandra, JMX, Solr, Tomcat.

# 5.0.5 (Every platform) / 10-31-2014
### Details
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/compare/5.0.4...5.0.5

This release fixes a bug on servers that are configured in local time instead of UTC Time.
If your server's clock is configured to use daylight saving time, your server might stop sending metrics for up to one hour when the Daylight Saving Time ends or until the Agent is restarted after the Daylight Saving Time ends.

We highly recommend to upgrade to this version if your server is configured in local time.

# 5.0.4 (deb package, rpm package) / 10-17-2014
### Details
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/compare/5.0.3...5.0.4

This is a security update regarding POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).

The Omnibus package will now bundle OpenSSL 1.0.1j without support of SSLv3 (no-ssl3 flag) and Python 2.7.8 with a patch that disables SSLv3 unless explicity asked http://bugs.python.org/issue22638.

This Omnibus package also adds support of the sqlite3 library for Python.

# 5.0.3 (Windows only)
### Details
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/compare/5.0.2...5.0.3

* [FEATURE] Batching jobs to cache the infrastructure of vCenter when autodiscovering Hosts/VMs is configurable
* [BUGFIX] Fix ESXi host tags not being correctly set
* [BUGFIX] Fix metadata reset so that metrics processing is not stopped when refreshing metadata
* [BUGFIX] Fix thread pool crash when one thread would not terminate gracefully

# 5.0.2 (Windows only)

# 5.0.0 / 08-22-2014
### Details
https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/compare/4.4.0...5.0.0

### Notes

This is a major version of the Datadog-Agent.

* On Linux:
Packaging of the Agent has changed for RPM and DEB packages.

* On Windows:
This release has multiple fixes, see the list below.
Warning: The way CPU metrics are collected has changed and will be more accurate, you might see some changes in the graphs.

### What will break ?
* MySQL integration: If you see this error: ```OperationalError(2003, 'Can\'t connect to MySQL server on \'localhost\' ((1045, u"Access denied for user \'datadog\'@\'127.0.0.1\'...)```
the Datadog user will need to be modified from ```'datadog'@'localhost'``` to ``` 'datadog'@'127.0.0.1' ``` (your host IP). You can do this by running:

       ```
           $ mysql -p mysql
           # UPDATE user SET Host = '127.0.0.1' WHERE User = 'datadog';
           # FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       ```
* If you were using a custom check that needed python dependencies you will have to reinstall them using the bundled pip:

       ```
sudo /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install YOUR_DEPENDENCY
       ```
* Configuring checks in datadog.conf for checks.d is deprecated and won't work anymore. Please configure your checks by editing the yaml files in the conf.d directory.

### How to upgrade from 3.0.4 on Debian and Ubuntu

When we released datadog-agent 3.0.4 we made a mistake and messed up the version dependency between packages. As a result, whenever you run `apt-get upgrade` or `apt-get dist-upgrade` and 3.0.4 is installed you may get the following error:

`E: Couldn't configure pre-depend datadog-agent-base for datadog-agent, probably a dependency cycle.`

If that's the case, don't panic: there is a simple fix. Simply run:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get remove datadog-agent
    sudo apt-get install datadog-agent

to get the new versions up-and-running.

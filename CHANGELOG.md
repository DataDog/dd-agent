# 5.0.5 (Every platform) / 10-31-2014

This release fixes a bug on servers that are configured in local time instead of UTC Time.
If your server's clock is configured to use daylight saving time, your server might stop sending metrics for up to one hour when the Daylight Saving Time ends or until the Agent is restarted after the Daylight Saving Time ends.

We highly recommend to upgrade to this version if your server is configured in local time.

# 5.0.4 (deb package, rpm package) / 10-17-2014

This is a security update regarding POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).

The Omnibus package will now bundle OpenSSL 1.0.1j without support of SSLv3 (no-ssl3 flag) and Python 2.7.8 with a patch that disables SSLv3 unless explicity asked http://bugs.python.org/issue22638.

This Omnibus package also adds support of the sqlite3 library for Python.

# 5.0.3 (Windows only)

vSphere check:

* [FEATURE] Batching jobs to cache the infrastructure of vCenter when autodiscovering Hosts/VMs is configurable
* [BUGFIX] Fix ESXi host tags not being correctly set
* [BUGFIX] Fix metadata reset so that metrics processing is not stopped when refreshing metadata
* [BUGFIX] Fix thread pool crash when one thread would not terminate gracefully

# 5.0.2 (Windows only)

vSphere check:

* [FEATURE] Changed the event filter to remove login events by default
* [BUGFIX] Duplicate tags on VMs and host
* [BUGFIX] Ignore duplicate events about VM migrations

# 5.0.1 (Windows only)

[FEATURE] Releasing the vSphere check. This is a new integration able to fetch metrics and events from vCenter.

# 5.0.0 / 08-22-2014

### Notes

This is a major version of the Datadog-Agent.

* On Linux:
Packaging of the Agent has changed for RPM and DEB packages.

* On Windows:
This release has multiple fixes, see the list below.
Warning: The way CPU metrics are collected has changed and will be more accurate, you might see some changes in the graphs.

### What will break ?
* MySQL integration: If you see this error: ```OperationalError(2003, 'Can\'t connect to MySQL server on \'localhost\' ((1045, u"Access denied for user \'datadog\'@\'127.0.0.1\'...)```
the Datadog user will need to be modified from ```'datadog'@'localhost'``` to ``` 'datadog'@'127.0.0.1' ``` (your host IP). You can do this by running:

       ```
           $ mysql -p mysql
           # UPDATE user SET Host = '127.0.0.1' WHERE User = 'datadog';
           # FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
       ```
* If you were using a custom check that needed python dependencies you will have to reinstall them using the bundled pip:

       ```
sudo /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install YOUR_DEPENDENCY
       ```
* Configuring checks in datadog.conf for checks.d is deprecated and won't work anymore. Please configure your checks by editing the yaml files in the conf.d directory.

# 3.0.5

#### Changes

### How to upgrade from 3.0.4 on Debian and Ubuntu

When we released datadog-agent 3.0.4 we made a mistake and messed up the version dependency between packages. As a result, whenever you run `apt-get upgrade` or `apt-get dist-upgrade` and 3.0.4 is installed you may get the following error:

`E: Couldn't configure pre-depend datadog-agent-base for datadog-agent, probably a dependency cycle.`

If that's the case, don't panic: there is a simple fix. Simply run:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get remove datadog-agent
    sudo apt-get install datadog-agent

to get the new versions up-and-running.

# 3.0.4

#### Changes
* [FEATURE] [#112](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/112) Thanks to [@charles-dyfis-net](https://github.com/charles-dyfis-net), the agent supports extra `emitters`. An emitter is an output for events and metrics.
* [FEATURE] [#117](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/117) Thanks to [@rl-0x0](https://github.com/rl-0x0), the agent can now parse supervisord logs and turn them into events and metrics.
* [FEATURE] [#121](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/121) Thanks to [@charles-dyfis-net](https://github.com/charles-dyfis-net), the agent supports custom checks. Check out our README for more details.

    # By default, we only capture *some* of the metrics available in the
    # `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` table. You can easily add additional
    # metrics by following the custom_metrics structure shown below.
    #
    # In order to connect to SQL Server either enable SQL Authentication and
    # specify a username or password below. If you do not specify a username 
    # or password then we will connect using integrated authentication.

    #custom_metrics:
    #
    #    This is a basic custom metric. There is not instance assicated with
    #    this counter.
    #    Options for type are: gauge, rate, histogram
    #
    #    -   name: sqlserver.clr.execution
    #        type: gauge
    #        counter_name: CLR Execution
    #
    #    This counter has multiple instances assocaited with it and we're
    #    choosing to only fetch the '_Total' instance.
    #
    #    -   name: sqlserver.exec.in_progress
    #        type: gauge
    #        counter_name: OLEDB calls
    #        instance_name: Cumulative execution time (ms) per second
    #
    #    This counter has multiple instances assocaited with it and we want
    #    every instance available. We'll use the special case ALL instance
    #    which *requires* a value for "tag_by". In this case, we'll get metrics
    #    tagged as "db:mydb1", "db:mydb2".

  # of the default router to reach the cadvisor api.

  #
  # host: localhost
  # port: 4194

  # collect_events controls whether the agent should fetch events from the kubernetes API and
  # ingest them in Datadog. To avoid duplicates, only one agent at a time across the entire
  # cluster should have this feature enabled.

  # use_histogram controls whether we send detailed metrics, i.e. one per container.

  # to keep them unique.

init_config:

instances:
  # This config is for the Directory Check which is used to report metrics
  # for the files in a given directory
  #
  # For each instance, the 'directory' parameter is required, all others are optional.
  #
  # WARNING: Ensure the user account running the Agent (typically dd-agent) has read
  # access to the monitored directory and files.
  #
  # NOTE: on windows, please make sure you escape back-slashes otherwise the YAML
  #       parser will fail (eg. - directory: "C:\\Users\\foo\\Downloads").
  #
  # Instances take the following parameters:
  # "directory" - string, the directory to monitor. Required
  # "name" - string, tag metrics with specified name. defaults to the "directory"
  # "dirtagname" - string, the name of the tag used for the directory. defaults to "name"
  # "filetagname" - string, the name of the tag used for each file. defaults to "filename"
  # "filegauges" - boolean, when true stats will be an individual gauge per file (max. 20 files!) and not a histogram of the whole directory. default False
  # "pattern" - string, the `fnmatch` pattern to use when reading the "directory"'s files. The pattern will be matched against the files' absolute paths. default "*"
  # "recursive" - boolean, when true the stats will recurse into directories. default False
  # "countonly" - boolean, when true the stats will only count the number of files matching the pattern. Useful for very large directories.

  - directory: "/path/to/directory"

    # dirtagname: "tag_dirname"
    # filetagname: "tag_filename"
    # filegauges: False

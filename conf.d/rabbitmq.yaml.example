    # Use the `nodes` or `nodes_regexes` parameters to specify the nodes you'd like to
    # collect metrics on (up to 100 nodes).
    # If you have less than 100 nodes, you don't have to set this parameter,
    # the metrics will be collected on all the nodes by default.

    # Use the `queues` or `queues_regexes` parameters to specify the queues you'd like to
    # collect metrics on (up to 200 queues).
    # If you have less than 200 queues, you don't have to set this parameter,
    # the metrics will be collected on all the queues by default.
    # If you have set up vhosts, set the queue names as `vhost_name/queue_name`.
    # If you have `tag_families` enabled, the first captured group in the regex
    # will be used as the queue_family tag

    # Service checks:
    # By default a list of all vhosts is fetched and each one will be checked
    # using the aliveness API. If you prefer only certain vhosts to be monitored
    # with service checks then you can list the vhosts you care about.

    # vhosts:
    #   - vhost1

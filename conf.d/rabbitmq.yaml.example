  # for every instance a 'rabbitmq_api_url' must be provided, pointing to the api
  # url of the RabbitMQ Managment Plugin (http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)
  # optional: 'rabbitmq_user' (default: guest) and 'rabbitmq_pass' (default: guest)
  #
  # If you have less than 5 queues, you don't have to set the queues parameters
  # All queues metrics will be collected
  # If you have more than 5 queues: you can set 5 queue names. Metrics will be collected
  # for these queues. For the other queues, aggregate will be calculated.
  #
  # # If you have less than 3 nodes, you don't have to set the nodes parameters
  # All nodes metrics will be collected
  # If you have more than 3 nodes: you can set 3 node names. Metrics will be collected
  # for these nodes. For the other nodes, aggregate will be calculated.
  #
  # Warning: aggregate are calculated on the 100 first queues/nodes.
  #
  # Service checks:
  #
  # By default a list of all vhosts is fetched and each one will be checked
  # using the aliveness API. If you prefer only certain vhosts to be monitored
  # then you can list the vhosts you care about.

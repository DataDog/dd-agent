instances:
    # Each Event Log instance lets you define the type of events you want to
    # match and how to tag those events. You can use the following filters:
    #
    # - type: Warning, Error, Information
    #
    # - log_file: Application, System, Setup, Security
    #
    # - source_name: Any available source name
    #
    # - user: Any valid user name
    #
    # - message_filters: A list of message filters, using % as a wildcard.
    #   See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa392263(v=vs.85).aspx for
    #   more on the format for LIKE queries.
    #   NOTE: Any filter that starts with "-" will be a NOT query, e.g.: '-%success%'
    #   will search for events without 'success' in the message.
    #
    # Here are a couple basic examples:
    #
    # The following will capture errors and warnings from SQL Server which
    # puts all events under the MSSQLSERVER source and tag them with #sqlserver.
    #
    #-   tags:
    #        - sqlserver
    #    type:
    #        - Warning
    #        - Error
    #    log_file:
    #        - Application
    #    source_name:
    #        - MSSQLSERVER
    #    message_filters:
    #        - "%error%"
    #
    # This instance will capture all system errors and tag them with #system.
    #
    #-   tags:
    #        - system
    #    type:
    #        - Error
    #    log_file:
    #        - System

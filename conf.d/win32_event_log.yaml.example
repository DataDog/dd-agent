instances:
  # Each Event Log instance lets you define the type of events you want to
  # match and how to tag those events. You can use the following filters:
  #
  # - log_file: Application, System, Setup, Security
  #
  # - source_name: Any available source name
  #
  # - type: Warning, Error, Information
  #
  # - user: Any valid user name
  #
  # - event_id: The Event ID can be found through http://www.eventid.net/ and
  #   viewed in the window event viewer.
  #
  # - message_filters: A list of message filters, using % as a wildcard.
  #   See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa392263(v=vs.85).aspx for
  #   more on the format for LIKE queries.
  #   NOTE: Any filter that starts with "-" will be a NOT query, e.g.: '-%success%'
  #   will search for events without 'success' in the message.

  # Here are a couple basic examples:

  # The following will capture errors and warnings from SQL Server which
  # puts all events under the MSSQLSERVER source and tag them with #sqlserver.
  #
  # - log_file:
  #     - Application
  #   source_name:
  #     - MSSQLSERVER
  #   type:
  #     - Warning
  #     - Error
  #   message_filters:
  #     - "%error%"
  #   tags:
  #     - sqlserver

  # This instance will capture all system errors and tag them with #system.
  #
  # - log_file:
  #   - System
  #   type:
  #     - Error
  #   tags:
  #     - system

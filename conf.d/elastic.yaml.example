instances:
  # The URL where elasticsearch accepts HTTP requests. This will be used to
  # fetch statistics from the nodes and information about the cluster health.
  #
  # If you're using basic authentication with a 3rd party library, for example
  # elasticsearch-http-basic, you will need to specify a value for username
  # and password for every instance that requires authentication.
  #
  # If your cluster is hosted externally (i.e., you're not pointing to localhost)
  # you will need to set `cluster_stats` to true otherwise the check will only
  # submit metrics of the local node.
  # DEPRECATION:
  # This parameter was also called `is_external` and you can still use it but it
  # will be removed in version 6.
  #
  # The `report_cluter_hosts_tags` flags will add the hostnames when reporting
  # clustered metrics as tags. The tags will have the form 'elastic_search:<hostname>'
  # in Datadog. This parameter is enabled by default, it has no effect if `cluster_stats`
  # remains disabled.
  # LEGACY:
  # If the `cluster_hosts_as_tags` parameter is ommited we will default to the
  # legacy behavior that will report the elastic search clusters as hosts, not tags.
  #
  # If you enable the "pshard_stats" flag, statistics over primary shards
  # will be collected by the check and sent to the backend with the
  # 'elasticsearch.primary' prefix. It is particularly useful if you want to
  # get certain metrics without taking replicas into account. For instance,
  # 'elasticsearch.primaries.docs.count` will give you the total number of
  # documents in your indexes WITHOUT counting duplicates due to the existence
  # of replica shards in your ES cluster

  # The PowerDNS Recursor in v4 has a production ready web server that allows for
  # statistics gathering. In version 3.x the server was marked as experimental.
  #
  # As the server was marked as experimental in version 3 many of the metrics have
  # changed names and the API structure (paths) have also changed. With these changes
  # there has been a need to separate the two concerns. The check now has a key value
  # version: which if set to version 4 will query with the correct API path on the
  # non-experimental web server. If there is nothing set the in that key the check will
  # default to the version 3 metrics names and API paths.

instances:
    # By default, this check will run against a single instance - the current
    # machine that the Agent is running on. It will check the WMI performance
    # counters for IIS on that machine.
    #
    # If you want to check other remote machines as well, you can add one
    # instance per host. Note: If you also want to check the counters on the
    # current machine, you will have to create an instance with empty params.
    #
    # The `sites` parameter allows you to specify a list of sites you want to
    # read metrics from. With sites specified, metrics will be tagged with the
    # site name. If you don't define any sites, the check will pull the
    # aggregate values across all sites.
    #
    # Here's an example of configuration that would check the current machine
    # and a remote machine called MYREMOTESERVER. For the remote host we are
    # only pulling metrics from the default site.
    #
    #-  host: . # "." means the current host
    #   tags:
    #       - myapp1

    #   username: MYREMOTESERVER\fred
    #   password: mysecretpassword

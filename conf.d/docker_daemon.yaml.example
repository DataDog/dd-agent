  # Change the root directory to look at to get cgroup statistics. Useful when running inside a

  # Default: 5 seconds

    # Warning: if that's a non-local daemon, we won't be able to collect performance metrics.

    url: "unix://var/run/docker.sock"

    # Use TLS encryption while communicating with the Docker API
    #
    # tls: false

    # Cgroup root (HIDDEN OPTION?)
    # Directory where cgroup files are located, used to generate performance metrics.
    # Default: None (auto-detected)
    #
    # cgroup_path:

    # Cgroup layout (HIDDEN OPTION?)
    # How cgroup files are organized inside the cgroup root.
    # Default: None (auto-detected)
    # Example: "/%(cgroup_root)s/docker/%(container_id)s/%(file)s"

    ## Data collection
    ##

    # Create events whenever a container status change.
    #
    # collect_events: true

    # Collect disk usage per container with docker.container.size_rw and
    # docker.container.size_rootfs metrics.
    # Warning: This might take time for Docker daemon to generate,
    # ensure that `docker ps -a -q` run fast before enabling it.
    #
    # collect_container_size: false

    # Collect disk usage per image with docker.image.size and docker.image.virtual_size metrics.
    # The check gets this size with the `docker images` command.
    #
    # collect_image_size: true

    # Collect images stats
    # Number of available active images and intermediate images as gauges.
    # Defaults to true.
    #
    # collect_images_stats: false

    # Exclude containers based on their tags
    # An excluded container will be completely ignored. The rule is a regex on the tags.
    #
    # How it works: exclude first.
    # If a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included unless it also matches an include rule.
    # Examples:
    # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # exclude: [".*"]
    # include: ["docker_image:ubuntu", "docker_image:debian"]
    #
    # include all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # exclude: ["docker_image:ubuntu", "docker_image:debian"]
    # include: []
    #
    # Default: include all
    # exclude: []
    # include: []


    ## Tagging
    ##

    # You can add extra tags to your Docker metrics with the tags list option.
    # Example: ["extra_tag", "env:testing"]
    #
    # tags: []

    # Custom metrics tagging
    # Define which Docker tags to apply on metrics.
    # Since it impacts the aggregation, modify it carefully (only if you really need it).
    #
    # Tags for performance metrics.
    # Available:
    #   - image_name: Name of the image (example: "nginx")
    #   - image_tag: Tag of the image (example: "latest")
    #   - docker_image: LEGACY. The full image name:tag string (example: "nginx:latest")
    #   - container_id: Short id of the container (example: "ae3bc9c8ae5e")
    #   - container_name: Name of the container (example: "boring_euclid")
    #   - container_command: Command ran by the container (example: "echo 1")
    #
    # performance_tags: ["image_name", "container_name"]

    # Tags for containers count metrics.
    # Available: ["image_name", "image_tag", "docker_image", "container_command"]
    #
    # container_tags: ["image_name"]

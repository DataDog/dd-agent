    # Exclude containers based on their tags
    # An excluded container will ne longer report performance metrics or events. However,
    # we still count the number of running and stopped of all containers.
    #
    # How it works: if a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included
    # unless it also matches an include rule.
    # Examples:
    #
    # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # include:
    #   - "docker_image:ubuntu"
    #   - "docker_image:debian"
    # exclude:
    #   - ".*"
    #
    # include all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # include: []
    # exclude:
    #   - "docker_image:ubuntu"
    #   - "docker_image:debian"
    #
    # include: []
    # exclude: []

    # Create events whenever a container status change.

    # Warning: This feature is broken in some version of Docker (such as 1.2).
    # Test it before running it in production.

    # Collect all the available cgroups metrics. All the relevant metrics are collected by default.

    # Collect images stats
    # Number of available active images and intermediate images as gauges. Default: true.

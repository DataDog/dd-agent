  # Change the root directory to look at to get cgroup statistics. Useful when running inside a

  # Timeout on Docker socket connection. You may have to increase it if you have many containers.
  # socket_timeout: 5

  # Do you use custom cgroups for your containers? Also relevant if using systemd-docker.
  # Note: enabling this option modifies the way in which we inspect the containers and causes
  #       some overhead - if you run a high volume of containers we may timeout. Please only

    # You can add extra tags to your Docker metrics with the tags list option. Default: [].

    # tags: ["extra_tag", "env:example"]

    # Exclude containers based on their tags
    # An excluded container will ne longer report performance metrics or events. However,
    # we still count the number of running and stopped of all containers.
    #
    # How it works: if a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included
    # unless it also matches an include rule.
    # Examples:
    #
    # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # include:
    #   - "docker_image:ubuntu"
    #   - "docker_image:debian"
    # exclude:
    #   - ".*"
    #
    # include all, except ubuntu and debian.
    # include: []
    # exclude:
    #   - "docker_image:ubuntu"
    #   - "docker_image:debian"

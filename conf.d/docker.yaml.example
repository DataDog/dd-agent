init_config:
    # Change the root directory to look at to get cgroup statistics. Useful when running inside a
    # container with host directories mounted on a different folder. Default: /.
    #
    # docker_root: /host

instances:
    - url: "unix://var/run/docker.sock"

    # You can add extra tags to your Docker metrics with the tags list option. Default: [].
    #
    # tags: [extra_tag1, extra_tag2]

    # To include or exclude containers based on their tags, use the include and
    # exclude keys in your instance.
    # The reasoning is: if a tag matches an exclude rule, it won't be included
    # unless it also matches an include rule.
    #
    # Examples:
    # exclude all, except ubuntu and debian.
    #
    # include:
    #   - "image:ubuntu"
    #   - "image:debian"
    # exclude:
    #   - ".*"
    #
    # include all, except ubuntu and debian.
    #
    # include: []
    # exclude:
    #   - "image:ubuntu"
    #   - "image:debian"

    # If you want to include sub-cgroups metrics, turn the collect_total option on.
    # It is useless for a normal usage, as total_ metrics will be the same as normal ones. Default: false.
    #
    # collect_total: true

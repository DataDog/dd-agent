# Track per-relation (table) metrics
# The list of relations/tables must be specified here.
# Each relation generates many metrics (10 + 10 per index)
#
#    relations:
#      - my_table
#      - my_other_table
#
# By default all schemas are included. To track relations from specific schemas only, 
# use the following syntax:
#
#    relations:
#      - relation_name: another_table
#        schemas:
#          - public
#          - prod

# Custom metrics
# Below are some examples of commonly used metrics, which are implemented as custom metrics.
# Uncomment them if you want to use them as is, or use as an example for creating your own custom metrics. 
# The format for describing custome metrics is identical with the one used for common metrics in postgres.py
# Be extra careful with ensuring proper custom metrics description format. If your custom metric does not work 
# after an agent restart, look for errors in the output of "/etc/init.d/datadog-agent info" command, as well as 
# /var/log/datadog/collector.log file.

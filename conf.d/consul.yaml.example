# This check takes no init_config
init_config:

instances:
    # Where your Consul HTTP Server Lives
    # Remind to use https instead of http if your Consul setup is configured to do so.
    - url: http://localhost:8500

      # If Consul setup uses SSL, you might need to set the following options as well.

      # You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate
      # as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate concatenated)
      # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.concatenated.pem'

      # Or as two separate files (for certificate and key):
      # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.cert.pem'
      # private_key_file: '/path/to/private.key.pem'

      # Whether to verifiy SSL certificates for HTTPS requests.
      # Possible values: True, False or '/path/to/your/trusted_ca_bundle_file'
      # ca_bundle_file: '/path/to/trusted_ca_bundle_file'

      # Whether to perform checks against the Consul service Catalog
      catalog_checks: yes

      # Whether to enable self leader checks. Each instance with this enabled will
      # watch for itself to become the leader and will emit an event when that
      # happens. It is safe/expected to enable this on all nodes in a consul
      # cluster since only the new leader will emit the (single) event. This
      # flag takes precedence over new_leader_checks.
      self_leader_check: yes

      # Whether to enable new leader checks from this instance
      # Note: if this is set on multiple instances/agents in the same cluster
      # you will receive one event per leader change per instance. See
      # self_leader_check for a more robust option.
      new_leader_checks: yes

      # Whether to enable network latency metrics collection. When enabled
      # consul network coordinates will be retrieved and latency calculated for
      # each node and between data centers.
      # See https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/coordinates.html
      network_latency_checks: yes

      # Services to restrict catalog querying to
      # The default settings query up to 50 services. So if you have more than
      # this many in your Consul service catalog, you will want to fill in the
      # whitelist
      # service_whitelist:
      #   - zookeeper
      #   - gunicorn
      #   - redis

      # Additional tags to apply to the metrics, events and service checks
      # You should always specify tags when multiple instances of the check run
      # on the same agent.
      # tags:
      #   - 'consul_server:server1'

    # Where your Consul HTTP Server Lives
    # Remind to use https instead of http if your Consul setup is configured to do so.
    - url: http://localhost:8500

      # If Consul setup uses SSL, you might need to set the following options as well.

      # You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate
      # as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate concatenated)
      # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.concatenated.pem'

      # Or as two separate files (for certificate and key):
      # client_cert_file: '/path/to/client.cert.pem'
      # private_key_file: '/path/to/private.key.pem'

      # Whether to verifiy SSL certificates for HTTPS requests.
      # Possible values: True, False or '/path/to/your/trusted_ca_bundle_file'
      # ca_bundle_file: '/path/to/trusted_ca_bundle_file'

      # Whether to perform checks against the Consul service Catalog
      catalog_checks: yes

      # Whether to enable new leader checks from this agent
      # Note: if this is set on multiple agents in the same cluster
      # you will receive one event per leader change per agent
      new_leader_checks: yes

      # Number of services to restrict catalog checks to
      # By default, the catalog checks allow only 50 services, so if
      # you have more than this, you'll have to adjust this
      # number. Use any value less than 1 to query an unlimited number
      # of services.
      # max_services: 50

      # Services to restrict catalog querying to
      # The default settings query up to the first 50 services. If you
      # have more services than max_services above, you can either
      # pick the specific services to query for (any that exceed
      # max_services will be removed).
      # service_whitelist:
      #   - zookeeper
      #   - gunicorn
      #   - redis

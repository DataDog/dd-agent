  # The Spark check can retrieve metrics from Standalone Spark and YARN. Both
  # methods require the spark_url to be configured.
  #
  # For Spark Standalone, `spark_url` must be set to the Spark master's web
  # UI. This is http://localhost:8080 by default.
  #
  # For YARN, `spark_url` must be set to YARN's resource manager address. The
  # ResourceManager hostname can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file
  # under the property yarn.resourcemanager.address The ResourceManager port
  # can be found in the yarn-site.xml conf file under the property
  # yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address. This is http://localhost:8088 by default
  #
  # The use of `resourcemanager_uri` has been deprecated, but is still functional.

    # To enable monitoring of a Standalone Spark cluster, the spark cluster
    # mode must be set. Uncomment the cluster mode that applies.

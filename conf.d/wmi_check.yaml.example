instances:
  # Each WMI query has 2 required options, `class` and `metrics` and six 
  # optional options, `host`, `namespace`, `filters`, `tag_by`, `constant_tags` and `tag_queries`.
  #
  # `host` is the optional target of the WMI query, `localhost` is assumed by default
  # if you set this option, make sure that Remote Management is enabled on the target host
  # see https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh921475.aspx for more information
  #
  # `class` is the name of the WMI class, for example Win32_OperatingSystem
  # or Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process. You can find many of the
  # standard class names on the MSDN docs at
  # http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa394084.aspx.
  # The Win32_FormattedData_* classes provide many useful performance counters
  # by default.
  #
  # `namespace` is the optionnal WMI namespace to connect to (default to `cimv2`).
  #
  # `provider` is the optional WMI provider (default to `32` on Datadog Agent 32-bit or `64`).
  # It is used to request WMI data from the non-default provider. Available options are: `32` or `64`.
  # For more information: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa393067(v=vs.85).aspx
  #
  # `metrics` is a list of metrics you want to capture, with each item in the
  # list being a set of [WMI property name, metric name, metric type].
  #
  # - The property name is something like `NumberOfUsers` or `ThreadCount`.
  #   The standard properties are also available on the MSDN docs for each
  #   class.
  #
  # - The metric name is the name you want to show up in Datadog.
  #
  # - The metric type is from the standard choices for all agent checks, such
  #   as gauge, rate, histogram or counter.
  #
  # `filters` is a list of filters on the WMI query you may want. For example,
  # for a process-based WMI class you may want metrics for only certain
  # processes running on your machine, so you could add a filter for each
  # process name. You can also use the '%' character as a wildcard.
  # See below for examples.
  #
  # `tag_by` optionally lets you tag each metric with a property from the
  # WMI class you're using. This is only useful when you will have multiple
  # values for your WMI query. The examples below show how you can tag your
  # process metrics with the process name (giving a tag of "name:app_name").
  #
  # `constant_tags` optionally lets you tag each metric with a set of fixed values.
  #
  # `tag_queries` optionally lets you specify a list of queries, to tag metrics
  # with a target class property. Each item in the list is a set of
  # [link source property, target class, link target class property, target property]
  # where:
  #
  # - 'link source property' contains the link value
  #
  # - 'target class' is the class to link to
  #
  # - 'link target class property' is the target class property to link to
  #
  # - 'target property' contains the value to tag with
  #
  # It translates to a WMI query:
  # SELECT 'target property' FROM 'target class'
  #                 WHERE 'link target class property' = 'link source property'
  #
  # Note: setting this will cause any instance number to be removed from tag_by values
  # i.e. name:process#1 => name:process
  #
  # This feature is available starting with version 5.3 of the agent

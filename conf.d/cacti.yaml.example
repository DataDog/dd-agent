    # The Cacti checks requires access to the Cacti DB in MySQL and to the RRD
    # files that contain the metrics tracked in Cacti.
    # In almost all cases, you'll only need one instance pointing to the Cacti
    # database.
    #
    # The `rrd_path` will probably be '/var/lib/cacti/rra' on Ubuntu
    # or '/var/www/html/cacti/rra' on any other machines.
    #
    # The `field_names` is an optional parameter to specify which field_names 
    # should be used to determine if a device is a real device. You can let it 
    # commented out as the default values should satisfy your needs.
    # You can run the following query to determine your field names:
    #       SELECT
    #            h.hostname as hostname,
    #            hsc.field_value as device_name,
    #            dt.data_source_path as rrd_path,
    #            hsc.field_name as field_name
    #        FROM data_local dl
    #            JOIN host h on dl.host_id = h.id
    #            JOIN data_template_data dt on dt.local_data_id = dl.id
    #            LEFT JOIN host_snmp_cache hsc on h.id = hsc.host_id
    #                AND dl.snmp_index = hsc.snmp_index
    #        WHERE dt.data_source_path IS NOT NULL
    #        AND dt.data_source_path != ''
    #
    #
    #
    # The `rrd_whitelist` is a path to a text file that has a list of patterns,
    # one per line, that should be fetched. If no whitelist is specified, all
    # metrics will be fetched.
